\section{Captain America}
For as much progress that we've made,
  we've gone a little downhill
  these past fifty years or so \autocite{rogers:elements}.
I really don't know what much else to say,
  but I have this need to write some filler text
  so that something goes on to the next column.
Because columns are cool.

How cool?
\emph{Very} cool.
Let me \texttt{itemize} the ways!
Columns\dots
\begin{itemize}
\item make you look professional as shit, and
\item fit more content onto one page without being mean to your eyes.
\item Did I mention they make you look professional as shit?
\end{itemize}

For more reasons on why columns look professional
  (and what else looks professional),
  see \cite{compandtype}.

\section{Another!}
This document was written with \TeX! See also \cite{texbook}.
I don't really know anything about Captain America---sorry.
