Introduction
------------

This is an ongoing project to desseminate TeX and friends
 among those who would not otherwise come across it
 through their day-to-day activities.
While TeX is *heavily* used in graduate studies and research-level work,
 it is not as common for undergraduate work.
This project hopes to dissolve this barrier between
 undergraduate and graduate work so that everyone
 can create clean, professional, and maintainable
 documents with free software of time-tested quality and reliability.

For many people, TeX is seen as a replacement for Microsoft Word.
While TeX and Microsoft Word both solve the same problems,
 TeX is *not* Word *in the slightest*.
It takes a completely different but intuitively understandable approach
 to creating documents.
While Word encourages you to draw your paper on its page,
 TeX encourages you to form your paper in your mind---to truly understand
 what you *mean* with the words you type.
This project talks more on that within (`why-tex/`),
 so I hope you will download this repository,
 read it, and
 use it.
A lot of time has been spent organizing it. :-)


Creating the Documentation
--------------------------

There is an ongoing effort to ease the creation of documentation.
If you are already familiar with TeX, they are built as normal.
Seeing as how this is geared as
 a practical introduction to those
 *not* familiar with TeX,
 work is being done to automate this process with a `makefile`
 (or even, perhaps, a graphical interface).
