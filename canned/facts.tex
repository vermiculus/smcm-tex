\item[Platform]
  \LaTeX\ will run on any operating system.
  For the geeks out there, \LaTeX\ is \emph{not} written in Java
    or some other intermediary programming language---%
    it is compiled specificaly for your platform.
\item[Size]
  A standard \LaTeX\ installation will run you around four gigabytes of disk space;
  while still a bit costly, it is \emph{peanuts} to current availability.
