\begin{question}{Will \LaTeX\ slow down my computer?}
  Short answer: no.
  Long answer: absolutely not.
  However, if you choose to install \LaTeX\ in what is called an `indexed' directory
  (which the default locations are \emph{not}),
  your system will be bogged down for a few hours while
  it inventories all of the files that are part of \LaTeX.
  (There is almost \emph{never \emph{any}} reason to choose a non-default install.)
