\begin{abstract}
As opposed to \MicrosoftWord,
  \TeX\ is run on an input file and
  doesn't need to produce the final copy
  several times a second.
This means that \TeX\ can spend
  the necessary time needed
  to make your document
  look absolutely \emph{gorgeous},
  not to mention exceptionally readable.
(After all, \TeX\ was written to typeset the author's own books;
 his publisher's work (especially for mathematics) was not up to his standards.)
This short article hopes
  to expose some of the finer details
  of \TeX's workmanship.

\section{Kerning}
\label{sec:kerning}

\NewTerm{Kerning} is that space which separates the letters of a word.
It isn't particularly a property of the text that many people explicitly \emph{notice},
  but it is one that can make a word look \emph{bad} or \emph{good}.
Of course, those who know about kerning are \emph{cursed},\footnote{%
  \url{http://www.xkcd.com/1015} CC--BY--NC Randall Munroe.}
  but it is good to be able to spot the work of a professional,
  and kerning is one example of a professional concern.

\noindent
There are certain letters in the Latin alphabet that
  require special spacing when used together.
Most letters are mostly box-shaped (`h', `s', \dots),
  but there are several that have space
  throughout most of the glyph (`Y', `T', `L', \dots)
  or can otherwise look awkward when combined recklessly.
Thus, most typesetters in the days of hand-printing
  made special stamps for these combinations
  that had spacing that looked right.

Today, computers---not typesetters---control almost all of our document needs.
Computers do not follow these practices by default,
  and products like \MicrosoftWord\ simply do not have the capability.
Sometimes, this is barely noticeable (but still ugly to the trained eye),
  while other times the blunder is obvious and simply obtrusive.
See \autoref{tab:compare} for a visual comparison.



\section{Ligatures}
\label{sec:ligatures}

\NewTerm{Ligatures} are another such special treatment of letters.
When combined, some letters can `clash' with each other in rather ugly ways.
While viewed up close the `smushed' glyphs may seem a little strange,
  their appearance in text often goes unnoticed.
Free from the microdistraction of clashing letters,
  the reader is able to, well, read!
See \autoref{tab:compare} for a visual comparison.

\section{Small Caps}
\label{sec:small-caps}

\NewTerm{Small capitals} are uppercase letters set
  at the same height and width
  as surrounding lowercase letters.
They are used primarily to draw attention to words
  without overwhelming the surrounding text,
  such as the first few words of each chapter in a book.
Usually, the font information provides a `small caps' variant included,
  but \MicrosoftWord\ finds it faster to
  simply scale the existing capital letters
  to an `appropriate' size, resulting in overly-light strokes
  and a generally awkward `look' about it.

From Wikipedia:
\begin{quote}
  Because the support for the petite caps feature
    is absent from most desktop-publishing programs,
    many fonts use x-height small caps in the small-caps feature.
  Well designed small capitals are
    not simply scaled-down versions of normal capitals;
    they normally retain the same stroke weight
    as other letters and have a wider aspect ratio for readability.
\end{quote}
See \autoref{tab:compare} for a visual comparison of this as well.

\section{Justification}
\label{sec:justification}

Lastly, \TeX's justification algorithm (Knuth--Plass) is its great claim to fame.
While \MicrosoftWord\ does line breaking on a line-by-line basis,
  \TeX\ chooses a paragraph's breakpoints considering the entire paragraph,
  choosing the most feasible option available.
(This is one of the reasons \MicrosoftWord doesn't use the algorithm;
 even small changes in wording in one part of the paragraph
 can completely change the line breaks \TeX\ chooses---it will choose \emph{the best}.)
See the last page of this article for
  a wonderful demonstration and statistical analysis
  of this difference.
